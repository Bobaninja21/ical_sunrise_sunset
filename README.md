# ical_sunrise_sunset

I threw this together for very small personal use project in late 2009. I updated it for different versions of PHP, then in 2022 to add 12 hour time, accessibility fixes, location services, and updated the sunrise / sunset calculations. I only ever add to it and have never cleaned up the code - you get what you pay for.
